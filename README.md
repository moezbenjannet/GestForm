# GESTFORM

## Description

This program will create a random list of integers between -1000 and 1000.
For each number in the list, it will display a specific word based on these rules:

- if the element is divisible by 3 then "Geste" will be displayed
- if the element is divisible by 5 then "Forme" will be displayed
- if the element is divisible by 3 and 5 then "Gestform" will be displayed
- otherwise the value of the element will be displayed

Example let's say we have a list of [2, 3, 5, 15] then the result will be:

	2  
	Geste  
	Forme  
	Gestform
